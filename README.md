# learn-react-router

React Router is a routing library for React. It makes it easy to synchronize the components of your application with your URL, as well as providing easy nesting of components.

### Getting started

This guide will assume some basic knowledge of React. If you have none, start with the docs: http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/getting-started.html

You can use React Router by installing it via npm and using a module bundler such as browserify or webpack, or by using the [CDN](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/react-router).

In this guide we'll be using the npm module and [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/). If you have no experience using a module bundler, check out [this guide](https://github.com/jrans/React-Webpack-Hotloader) to get started.
